## Introduction

The IPL Cricket Score Predictor is a machine learning application designed to predict the final score of an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket match based on various match parameters. Leveraging historical match data, the application trains a regression model to forecast the total runs a batting team is expected to score by the end of their innings. The downloaded dataset `ipl_data_2016.csv` gives a ball by ball  breakdown of a set of IPL games from 2016 onwards, accessed from Kaggle.

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ipl-score-predictor.git
cd ipl-score-predictor
```
2. Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets

1. Dataset Files
- `ipl_data_2016.csv`: Contains a ball-by-ball data of IPL 2016 matches.
- `matches.csv`: Contains summary details of IPL matches, including match IDs and cities.
2. Ensure Data Availability: Place both `ipl_data_2016.csv` and `matches.csv` in the project directory.
3. Accessing the datafiles from orignal source
- `ipl_data_2016.csv`: Downloaded from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020?select=deliveries.csv. This gets downloaded as the file `deliveries.csv`, and has data from 2008 to 2024. Next manually delete rows of data from 2008 to 2015 and save the updated dataset as `ipl_data_2016.csv`.
- `matches.csv`: Download from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020?select=matches.csv.

## Model Training

**Note:** This is not essential to using the app.

1. Run the Training Script: Execute the Python script to preprocess data, train the model, evaluate performance, and save the trained pipeline.
```
python model_pipeline.py
```
2. Output
- Model Metrics: The script will print the R<sup>2</sup> score and Mean Absolute Error.
- Saved Model: The trained pipeline is saved as `ipl_pipeline.pkl` in the project directory.
